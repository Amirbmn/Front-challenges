💡 Abstract Description

This project abstracts weather visualization into an interactive user interface that dynamically adapts based on environmental inputs and API responses.
It merges asynchronous data handling with semantic design principles, demonstrating the interplay between real-world information flow and web-based representation — a small, functional model of responsive information architecture.
